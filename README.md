# Nfl_prediction_model:
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model designed to predict the final scores of American football games. Utilizing historical game statistics and leveraging the powerful RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn, the model provides predictions on game outcomes based on various team performance metrics.

Model Description:
The score predictor is built using Python and scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library. The model predicts the final scores (Final_home and Final_away) of American football games, offering insights into potential game outcomes.

Key Features:

- Data Preprocessing: The model includes comprehensive preprocessing of football game data, such as handling categorical data (team names) and numerical statistics.

- Feature Engineering: Incorporates advanced features like team win streaks compared against league averages, offering a nuanced understanding of team momentum.

- Random Forest Regression: Utilizes RandomForestRegressor, known for its robustness and accuracy in handling complex regression tasks.

- Evaluation Metrics: Employs metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) for model evaluation, ensuring the reliability of predictions.

Dataset:
The model is trained on a dataset comprising various game statistics, including:

Team names (home and away)
First downs, net pass yards, total yards
Turnovers, time of possession
Quarter-wise scores (1Q, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q)
Rush attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns
Interceptions, sacks, penalties
Year of the game


Usage:
To use the model:
Load your game statistics dataset.
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data.
Train the model using the RandomForestRegressor.
Evaluate the model's performance and adjust parameters as needed.
Use the prediction function to get score estimates for upcoming games.


Future Enhancements:
Integration of more granular data such as player-specific statistics.
Implementation of hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
Deployment of the model as a web service for easier access and broader usage.
